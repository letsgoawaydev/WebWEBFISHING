# webwebfishing
reversed code for https://webwebfishing.notnite.com with improvements in the future

todo:

- [ ] Reverse/Beautify index.js variable names (mostly complete)
- [x] Decompile Steam.gdc using GDRETools
- [ ] Write websocket server code


ideas for the future:

- saving the exe in the browser's cache
- automatic saving and loading of save files like how https://vscode.dev does
- better pre game load ui
- [itch.io version](https://lamedeveloper.itch.io/webfishing) online support
